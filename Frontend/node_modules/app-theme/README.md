# AppTheme - a React.js components library to develop in-browser applications

The aim of this library is to provide a set of components to reproduce the common UI elements of a desktop application.

It is freely inspired by the Visual Studio Code color palette and elements.

It is designed with desktop-size screens, so no mobile support.
